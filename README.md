# US Population Estimates 2019
### [US Population Map](https://fogartycb.github.io/US_Population_Estimates_2019/)
-------------
This map is a proportional symbol map that is representing the US population estimates from the year 2019 in each state.  On the map you can see different circle sizes which represent the population for the state.  The bigger the circle, the bigger the population and the smaller the circle, the smaller the population.  The user can zoom in or out of the map and can click the circles to see the state and their population that circle represents.  These interactive elements makes it easier for the user to better understand the map and the data being shown.  This map and data can be useful for looking at any problems, questions, or anything that has to do with population.  It can also be used to compare population sizes from different years to see how they have changed in the United States.  

In order to make this map, data from the US Census Bureau on the population estimates was taken and turned into a GeoJSON file.  The data had to be a GeoJSON format in order for it to be used in javascript which was used to make this map.  Map elements such as a scale bar, title, and the sources used were also added to help complete the map.  After completing all the necessary coding to produce this map in an HTML document, Github was used to host the map.
